                    <p class="mt-1" style="color:green;">Although it took us a lot of time to climb that mountain but we all knew it was worth it when we reached the top and had the view of city ajmer from there. While climbing u wern't really conciderate of urself being drop from there so i was holding ur shirt again and again to pull u back from the edge of the rocks. You still didn't listen and cliked this photo being very close to the edge.</p>

                    <p class="mt-1" style="color:black;">When we booked our ticket for return to delhi we had a lot of time to kill so we went through our gallery and checked we didn't have many nice photos so we thought let us click more photos here on the station till the train comes. So we both took photos there too.. and you made few short videos to make a reel. </p>

                    <p class="mt-1" style="color:brown;">Two tired souls resting after climbing a straight hill. It was really tough to climb it. Anyone with low stamina wouldn't be able to all those things in one day that we did. Kudos to us.</p>

                    <p class="mt-1" style="color:blue;">Our first trip Out of Delhi. It was really hard for all of us to make it possible but we somehow did. Nobody knew where we were going but we were happy and somehow ended up choosing Agra and Mathura as our final location. It was such a great Idea coz it was time of janmashtmi and Mathura is the best place to celebrate it. I still remember we didn't purchase any ticket returning from there. The memorable trip ever.</p>
